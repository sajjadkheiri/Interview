# Test

## What is AAA

- **Arrange:** Set up the test's input values and prepare the prerequisites
- **Act:** Perform the actual work of the test
- **Assert:** Verify the result

## TDD vs BDD

- **TDD** is a development approach where developers $\textsf{\color{#fbbc05}{owrite tests before writing the actual code}}$.
 The goal is to ensure that the code being developed meets the requirements from the outset.

        1. Write Test / 2. Write code / 3. Refactor / 4. Repeat  

- **BDD** emphasizes $\textsf{\color{#fbbc05}{ocollaboration between developers}}$, testers, and non-technical stakeholders to $\textsf{\color{#fbbc05}{odefine how the application should behave}}$.

    BDD uses a natural language syntax that all team members understand.

        1. Define Behavior / 2. Write Tests in Gherkin Syntax (Given-When-Then) / 3. Write Code to Pass Tests
